#+TITLE: Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for Advent of Code 2020.

* Installation

I tried to use Nix to set up local development environments. For each day you can ~cd~ into the respective directory and use ~nix-shell~ to install all the dependencies you need. I ran into some issues with installing Clojure with Nix so this doesn't apply for the days when I used that language.

Specific commands to run the programs for each day are specified below.

* Solutions

** Day 1: SWI Prolog

~nix-shell --pure --run "swipl day1.pl"~

** Day 2: Clojure

- Clojure: ~clojure day2.clj~

- Babashka: ~bb day2.clj~

** Day 3: Elixir

~nix-shell --pure --run "elixir day3.exs"~

** Day 4: Elixir

~nix-shell --pure --run "elixir day4.exs"~
